            Hey, my name is Vincent Moreno. I am a 20 something year old who isn't working in his dream role (yet. üëãüòÅ ). <br/><br/>
            "Time and tide wait for no man." is a phrase that really resonates with me
            and something I apply to every facet of my life. I have a very steadfast personality. I actually enjoy
            being humbled.
            The greatest levels of happiness I have experienced came from learning, and executing what I've
            learned practically. <br/><br/>
            My professional background is in 'People Management' but, my true passion is
            building things with technology. My favorite thing about coding is the
            problem-solving aspect of everything. Struggling and figuring out the solution is a wonderful feeling.
            <br/><br/>
            Please check out the links on the right if you're interested in connecting with me, and seeing my code.
            <br/>
