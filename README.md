This is the source code to my website.

## How it's made

### React

This project started it's life as create-react-app boilerplate code. Soon it's expanded to feature various reusable components found in the /components/folder.

### CSS

Pure CSS. Well, lots of flex-box. No tailwind, or SASS.

### ThreeJS / [fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

That cool spinny vertigo background is created with ThreeJS.

### framer-motion

All those sweet, smooth, volumptuous animations are made using [framer-motion](https://github.com/framer/motion).
